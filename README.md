WiFi Collector is a project made in my subject of "Systems Architecture" in my Telecomunicationes degree at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

It is an application where you can collect information about Wi-Fi wireless networks detected by a mobile device at a specific time and place. The information about these networks that are introduced in the application, are in .txt files inside the "cells" folder.

For more information, you can see all the characteristics and requirements for the project in the document "Project".
